# Project-Library

This project was created as a part of the Odin Project Curriculum . The use of objects and their creation using constructor function was the main highlight of the object . Few things learnt : 
1. When you create an object with a new keyword it gets associated with the prototype and every object that is created with the a constructor function will have the same constructor prototype . 
2. You can't append the same child node under a parent node , basically it will just shift its position and not create a new node so for appending the same node mutliple times under a node you can use cloneNode() function. 
3. Dialog elements in HTML and interaction in JS with them.
